# Solution statement:

 Build a simple web app that shows the most recent jobs for software engineering jobs in the last 48 hours.

These are their key use-cases:

*As a job seeker, I want to see more jobs outside of Software Engineering
*As a job seeker, I want to see the jobs by their respective categories 
*As a job seeker, I want to be able to filter jobs (on page, not navigating elsewhere)
*As a job seeker, I want to be able to mail a job to a friend (using `mailto:` is good enough)

# Contribution to the solution:

I used Jira to track what I needed to do for the project, used  my wireframe from sprint # I refactor my layout with tailwindcss .When a use enters an input and submits for a job result, the information/api is displayed. I created functionality with javascript: I used ayscn/await funcation to fecth the data, event listnters and dom manipulation to have the job search results to display in the html file.  I was able to use paramters that specify the location to Massachestts and the job title of Software engineering. I created variables where I used to to display the objects in the jobposting. created filters, job category, the ability to email the job posting, and go directly to the site to apply.<img width="851" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 8 18 24 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82053164/128581682-75f967c5-d08d-485c-bff0-5e3983aea120.png">
